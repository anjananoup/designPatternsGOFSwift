# The Gang of Four - Design Patterns using Swift in iOS

Christopher Alexander says, "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over
and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution
to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times
over, without ever doing it the same way twice" [AIS+77]

Design Patters are the solutions of our programmers implementation problems. 
In this Branch, I will try to illustrate all 23 original design patters provided by "The Gang of Four".

## "The Gang of Four" are:
- **Erich Gamma**
- **Richard Helm**
- **Ralph Johnson**
- **John Vlissides**
